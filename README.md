Encoder-simulator-8-24V
=======================

Simulates a high or low side encoder at 0.5-1KHZ frequencies

A handy High or Low side encoder tester for industrial encoder simulation applications .  The unit is externally powered by 5-24V DC and outputs pulses at more or less the same voltage as the supply.  A rotary pot controls direction and rate of encoder simulating.  Moving the power supply for the opamp to VIN will give you another .6V on the high side if required.

You can get the cases from maplin or ebay; putting a magnet inside makes it convenient to use in panels etc.
